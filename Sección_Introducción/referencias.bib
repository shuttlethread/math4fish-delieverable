abstract = {The 2020 edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture has a particular focus on sustainability. This reflects a number of specific considerations. First, 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (the Code). Second, several Sustainable Development Goal indicators mature in 2020. Third, FAO hosted the International Symposium on Fisheries Sustainability in late 2019, and fourth, 2020 sees the finalization of specific FAO guidelines on sustainable aquaculture growth, and on social sustainability along value chains. While Part 1 retains the format of previous editions, the structure of the rest of the publication has been revised. Part 2 opens with a special section marking the twenty fifth anniversary of the Code. It also focuses on issues coming to the fore, in particular, those related to Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its indicators for which FAO is the “custodian” agency. In addition, Part 2 covers various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture sustainability. The topics discussed range widely, from data and information systems to ocean pollution, product legality, user rights and climate change adaptation. Part 3 now forms the final part of the publication, covering projections and emerging issues such as new technologies and aquaculture biosecurity. It concludes by outlining steps towards a new vision for capture fisheries. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and up-to-date information to a wide audience – policymakers, managers, scientists, stakeholders and indeed everyone interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.},

abstract = {The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Roadmap is the general framework aimed toward implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) in NAFO. The core principles are: a) the approach has to be objective-driven, b) it should consider long-term ecosystem sustainability, c) it must be place-based, and d) the consequences of trade-offs in managing human activities have to be explicitly defined. The Roadmap is not a fixed plan; it evolves as different components are developed, refined, and implemented. Core elements of the Roadmap include the identification of ecosystem-based management units, a hierarchical approach to define exploitation rates by considering ecosystem, multispecies, and stock level sustainability, and the integration of impacts on benthic communities. The modular design of the plan has allowed NAFO to start implementing some components (e.g. closures to bottom fishing for the protection of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems), while work on others is still ongoing (e.g. multispecies modelling). Even though the Roadmap is far from being fully implemented, NAFO has made important progress towards EAF over the last decade. This paper summarizes the Roadmap structure and the current level of implementation, describes some of the challenges faced, and examines those still ahead.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference.

@techreport{Lart2019,
abstract = {Introduction Fish populations are divided into 'stocks' for management and assessment purposes. The biological unit stock, which is the normal unit in which fish stocks are assessed is considered to be a self-contained biological population and is the unit discussed here. Management stocks may be combinations of biological stocks and are used as management units. Ideally the biological and management stocks should coincide however this is not always the case. This note explains the basis of the analytical methods used by ICES and other scientific organisations to assess fish stocks and the reference points used to assess their status against. Stock Assessments Fish stock assessments calculate: • Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB); which is a measure of the reproductive capacity of the stock, measured in tonnes. • Fishing mortality (F); the rate at which fish are removed from the stock by fishing In order to help managers manage each stock has a designated set of reference points against which is the stock is assessed. This document explains the basis of the reference points, and the ways in which they are presented in the Ecoregion descriptions. Analytical stock assessment models use estimates from catch data and research vessel surveys, of the growth, recruitment, fishing and natural mortality of a stock. The inputs and outputs into the stock are modelled as shown diagrammatically below; Figure 1 illustrates a simple model of a fish stock, modelled on a single stock basis Fish Stock biomass; Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) Recruitment of young fish Growth of fish Natural Mortality; death due natural causes Fishing Mortality (F); death due to fishing Fish stock assessment models and ICES reference points 2 To keep the stock at equilibrium growth and recruitment of young fish must at least balance the outputs due to death from fishing and natural mortality. The scientists can make predictions of what the likely effects of different management options (for example total catches, selectivity measures) would be on the fish stock biomass. The Spawning Stock Biomass is calculated as the proportion of the fish stock biomass which is in breeding condition Spawning Stock Biomass reference points},

Meeting these goals requires increased efficiency at all steps in the assessment process from data processing, through model development and selection, to report writing and review. Here, we describe one widely used tool that has proven successful in increasing the efficiency of the assessment process: the r4ss package, which supports the use of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework. What began 15 years ago as a tool to provide simple model diagnostics, including plots showing data and model results, has grown into a large collection of R functions to support many aspects of the assessment process. We provide an overview of the r4ss features and illustrate its utility with examples from recent applications. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing development of r4ss that can be applied to similar efforts associated with the next generation of stock assessment packages.},
